          JavaScript & Random Oddities</h1>
          <p class="greeting">Ok, so I baited you in with the title and to be honest that doesn't bode well for you going forward. Pick a quiz that you'll likely fail miserably.
            It'll be fun either way...ok there I go again, I lied, it won't be fun at all
          it'll be challenging as heck but you got this right?
        Let's be honest with ourselves, no you don't but let's just get started anyway shall we?
      Oh and remember...at least you tried.</p>
